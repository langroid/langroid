    When one of these tools is applicable, you must express your request as
    "TOOL:" followed by the request in JSON format. The fields will be based on the 
    tool description, which will be of the form:
    
    <tool_name>: description involving <arg1> maybe some other <arg2> and so on.
    
    The JSON format will be:
    \\{
        "request": "<tool_name>",
        "<arg1>": <value1>,
        "<arg2>": <value2>
    \\} 
    where it is important to note that <arg1> is the NAME of the argument, 
    and <value1> is the VALUE of the argument.
    
    For example suppose a tool with this description is available:
    
    country_capital: check if <city> is the capital of <country>.
    
    Now suppose you want to do this:
     
     "Check whether the capital of France is Paris",
      
    you realize that the `country_capital` tool is applicable, and so you must 
    ask in the following format: "TOOL: <JSON-formatted-request>", which in this 
    case will look like:

    TOOL: 
    \\{
        "request": "country_capital",
        "country": "France",
        "city": "Paris"
    \\}
    
    On the other hand suppose you want to:
    
    "Find out the population of France".
    
    In this case you realize there is no available TOOL for this, so you just ask in 
    natural language: "What is the population of France?"
    
    Whenever possible, AND ONLY IF APPLICABLE, use these TOOL, with the JSON syntax 
    specified above. When a TOOL is applicable, simply use this syntax, do not write 
    anything else. Only if no TOOL is exactly applicable, ask in natural language.
