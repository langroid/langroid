# HTML Logger Auto-Refresh Feature

## Summary
Added automatic refresh capability to the HTML logger with persistent UI state management.

## Key Changes
- **Auto-refresh**: HTML logs now refresh every 2 seconds using meta refresh tag
- **Visual hierarchy**: Replaced asterisk markers with opacity-based importance indicators
  - Important entries: full opacity (1.0)
  - Non-important entries: faded (0.4 opacity)
- **State persistence**: All interactive elements maintain state across refreshes using localStorage
  - Filter checkbox state
  - Entry expand/collapse states
  - Collapsible section states

## Technical Details
- Added `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2">` for automatic page refresh
- Implemented `flush()` after file writes for immediate updates
- Updated filter label from "Show only valid responses (*)" to "Show only important responses"
- Fixed line length issues to comply with 88-character limit

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- Fixed test checking for model name in header to check for task name instead
