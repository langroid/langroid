# Progress Bars for Document Ingestion

## Summary
Added progress bar support for document ingestion in `DocChatAgent` to provide visual feedback during large document processing.

## Changes
- Added optional `progress_callback` parameter to `VectorStore.add_documents()` method
- Implemented progress tracking in all vector store implementations (QdrantDB, ChromaDB, LanceDB, PostgresDB, etc.)
- Updated `DocChatAgent.ingest_docs()` to display rich progress bars for embedding generation and document storage
- Progress bars automatically appear for ingestions with more than 10 documents

## Benefits
- Users can now see real-time progress during document ingestion
- Separate progress tracking for embedding generation and storage phases
- Non-breaking change - existing code continues to work without modification
- Flexible callback system allows custom progress implementations
