# Code Analysis Packages


Creating a Dockerfile to containerize a Python project involves understanding
the project's dependencies and execution flow. Here are some tools that can help
you analyze a Python repo for this purpose:

1. **pipdeptree**: This tool is used to show a dependency tree of the installed
   Python packages. This can be helpful in determining what packages your Python
   project depends on.

2. **pipreqs**: `pipreqs` is used to generate requirements.txt file for any
   project based on the imports used in the project. It's a great tool if the
   repo does not already have a `requirements.txt` file.

3. **safety**: `safety` is a tool for checking your installed dependencies for
   known security vulnerabilities. It's a good practice to use this before
   creating Docker images to ensure you're not including vulnerable packages.

4. **pylint** and **flake8**: These are Python static code analysis tools which
   look for programming errors, help enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for
   some code smells. They can help you understand the code quality and
   structure, making it easier to write a Dockerfile.

5. **bandit**: This is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python
   code. As with `safety`, this is a good tool to run before creating your
   Docker image.

These tools will help you understand the dependencies and code quality of your
Python project, making it easier to create a Dockerfile. Remember that a
Dockerfile for a Python project typically needs to include commands to set up
the Python environment, install dependencies, and run the project.

An example Dockerfile for a Python application might look like this:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Add current directory code to the Docker image
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

In this Dockerfile, `app.py` represents the entry point to your application
and `requirements.txt` lists the Python dependencies. This is just a simple
example; the exact commands you'll need to use will depend on your specific
project.
