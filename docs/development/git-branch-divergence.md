# Git Branch Divergence

To avoid divergence from and conflicts with the main branch, your collaborator
should frequently run the following Git commands while working on their feature
branch:

1. `git fetch origin`: Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
   without merging them. This allows you to see if there have been updates to
   the main branch.

2. `git pull origin main`: Pull the latest changes from the main branch of the
   remote repository and merge them into the current branch. This helps keep the
   feature branch up-to-date with the main branch and reduces the chances of
   conflicts.

3. `git merge main`: If the feature branch is already checked out and you have
   fetched the latest changes from the main branch, you can use this command to
   merge the main branch into the feature branch. This is an alternative
   to `git pull origin main`.

4. `git rebase main`: Instead of merging, you can rebase the feature branch onto
   the main branch. This replays the feature branch's commits on top of the main
   branch, creating a linear history. This can help reduce conflicts, but be
   cautious when using this command, as it can rewrite commit history. Make sure
   to fetch the latest changes from the main branch before rebasing.

Note that before running `git merge main` or `git rebase main`, ensure that you
have fetched the latest changes from the remote repository
using `git fetch origin`.

By frequently running these commands, your collaborator can minimize divergence
from the main branch and reduce the risk of conflicts when merging their work.
