# Automatically fixing pep8 issues raised by `flake8`


!!! note
   Caveat Lector. May not be fully accurate. Trust but Verify!



To automatically fix PEP8 issues found by Flake8, you can use a tool
called `autopep8`. `autopep8` is a command-line utility that automatically
formats Python code to comply with the PEP8 style guide. It can be used in
conjunction with Flake8 to fix the issues reported.

First, you'll need to install `autopep8`. You can do this using `pip`:

```
pip install autopep8
```

Once `autopep8` is installed, you can run it on a specific file like this:

```
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive <file_name>.py
```

This command will modify the file in place, applying the auto-formatting.
The `--aggressive` flag is used twice to apply more aggressive changes. You can
adjust the number of `--aggressive` flags to control how much the code is
changed.

If you want to automatically fix all PEP8 issues in a directory, you can use the
following command:

```
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive --recursive <directory_path>
```

This command will apply the formatting changes to all Python files in the
specified directory and its subdirectories.

After running `autopep8`, you can use `flake8` to check if all PEP8 issues have
been resolved:

```
flake8 <file_name>.py
```

Keep in mind that `autopep8` might not fix all issues reported by Flake8, as
some issues might require manual intervention.

# `autoflake`: fix unused imports

`autopep8` primarily focuses on formatting issues in Python code to make it
compliant with the PEP8 style guide. It does not handle issues like unused
imports, which are usually reported by linters like Flake8 or pylint.

To automatically remove unused imports, you can use a tool
like `autoflake`. `autoflake` is a command-line utility that removes unused
imports and variables from Python code.

First, you'll need to install `autoflake` using `pip`:

```
pip install autoflake
```

Once `autoflake` is installed, you can run it on a specific file like this:

```
autoflake --in-place --remove-all-unused-imports <file_name>.py
```

This command will modify the file in place, removing all unused imports.

If you want to automatically remove unused imports from all Python files in a
directory, you can use the following command:

```
autoflake --in-place --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive <directory_path>
```

This command will remove unused imports from all Python files in the specified
directory and its subdirectories.

You can use a combination of `autopep8` and `autoflake` to fix both formatting
issues and remove unused imports. However, keep in mind that some issues might
still require manual intervention.

# `isort`: sort imports

`autoflake` is a tool specifically designed to remove unused imports and unused
variables from Python code. It does not fix other issues reported by Flake8,
which might include naming conventions, code complexity, or other style
violations.

To fix a wider range of issues automatically, you can combine multiple tools
like `autopep8`, `autoflake`, and `isort`. Each tool addresses specific issues:

1. `autopep8`: Handles code formatting according to the PEP8 style guide.
2. `autoflake`: Removes unused imports and unused variables.
3. `isort`: Sorts and organizes imports according to PEP8 and other configurable
   styles.

First, install `isort` using `pip`:

```
pip install isort
```

Then, you can run `isort` on a specific file or a directory like this:

```
isort <file_name>.py
```

or

```
isort <directory_path>
```

By using a combination of these tools, you can automatically fix a broader range
of issues reported by Flake8. However, it's important to note that not all
issues can be automatically resolved, and some might still require manual
intervention.

Additionally, you can use tools like `black` or `yapf` as alternative
auto-formatters that handle more than just PEP8 formatting. These tools enforce
a more opinionated style, which might help you address more issues
automatically.

# `yapf`

`yapf` (Yet Another Python Formatter) is an open-source Python code formatter
developed by Google. It aims to improve code readability by automatically
reformatting Python code according to a predefined style or a custom
configuration. While `yapf` can format code according to the PEP8 style guide,
it is more flexible and allows for additional customization.

To install `yapf`, you can use `pip`:

```
pip install yapf
```

Once `yapf` is installed, you can run it on a specific file like this:

```
yapf --in-place <file_name>.py
```

This command will modify the file in place, applying the auto-formatting.

To automatically format all Python files in a directory, you can use the
following command:

```
yapf --in-place --recursive <directory_path>
```

This command will apply the formatting changes to all Python files in the
specified directory and its subdirectories.

`yapf` uses a `.style.yapf` configuration file to define the formatting rules.
By default, it follows the PEP8 style guide, but you can create your
own `.style.yapf` file to customize the formatting rules according to your
preferences. The configuration file can be placed in the root directory of your
project, and `yapf` will automatically use it when formatting the code.

Some of the available customization options in `yapf` include:

- Column limit: Set the maximum line length.
- Indentation width: Define the number of spaces used for indentation.
- Continuation indent: Specify the indentation level for line continuations.
- Blank lines around top-level definitions: Control the number of blank lines
  around top-level functions and classes.

For more information on `yapf` and its configuration options, you can refer to
the official documentation: https://github.com/google/yapf

# Misc tools

While many tools focus on formatting and code style, there are a few that
address other issues reported by Flake8, such as code complexity or unused
variables. Some of these tools include:

1. `autoflake`: As mentioned earlier, `autoflake` removes unused imports and
   unused variables. It doesn't fix a wide range of Flake8 issues but can help
   with specific types of warnings.

2. `pylint`: While `pylint` is primarily a linter that checks for errors, code
   smells, and style violations, it also comes with a `--py3k` flag that can
   help identify and fix some issues related to Python 2 to Python 3 migration.
   However, it doesn't automatically fix the issues it reports.

3. `pyupgrade`: This tool can automatically upgrade your Python code to use
   newer syntax features. It is useful for cleaning up legacy code and adopting
   newer language constructs. It doesn't fix all Flake8 issues but can help
   address some related to outdated syntax.

   Install `pyupgrade` using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install pyupgrade
   ```

   Run `pyupgrade` on a specific file or directory:

   ```
   pyupgrade --py3-plus <file_name>.py
   ```

   or

   ```
   find <directory_path> -name "*.py" -exec pyupgrade --py3-plus {} \;
   ```

4. `reorder-python-imports`: This tool reorders and categorizes Python imports
   according to the specified style. It is more focused on import organization
   than `isort` and is more opinionated. It can help fix some import-related
   Flake8 issues.

   Install `reorder-python-imports` using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install reorder-python-imports
   ```

   Run `reorder-python-imports` on a specific file or directory:

   ```
   reorder-python-imports <file_name>.py
   ```

   or

   ```
   find <directory_path> -name "*.py" -exec reorder-python-imports {} \;
   ```

While these tools can help you address some of the issues reported by Flake8,
none of them provide a comprehensive solution. It's often necessary to use a
combination of tools and manual intervention to fix all problems in your code.
