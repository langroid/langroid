# Clustering Embedding Vectors

To find top K clusters in a vector database like Qdrant, you would typically:

1. Export the vectors from Qdrant.
2. Use a clustering algorithm (like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering)
   in a data analysis library to find clusters in the vectors.
3. Pick the top K clusters based on some criterion (like cluster size or cluster
   density).

That said, here is an example of how you could do this using Python, assuming
that you've already populated your Qdrant database with vectors:

```python
import requests
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Step 1: Retrieve vectors from Qdrant
response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:6333/collections/mycollection/points', json={
        'vector': {
            'from': 0,
            'size': 10000,  # the number of vectors to retrieve
        },
    })
response_json = response.json()
vectors = np.array([point['vector'] for point in response_json['points']])

# Step 2: Cluster the vectors using K-means
k = 5  # number of clusters to find
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)
kmeans.fit(vectors)

# Step 3: Get the top K clusters
# This will give you the cluster labels for each vector
cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_

# Count the number of vectors in each cluster
clusters, counts = np.unique(cluster_labels, return_counts=True)

# Sort the clusters by their size, and get the top K
top_k_clusters = clusters[np.argsort(-counts)][:k]

print(f'Top {k} clusters: {top_k_clusters}')
```

Please note that Qdrant does not support the direct retrieval of all vectors via
an API (as in this example) as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. You
would likely have to track the vectors yourself before adding them to Qdrant or
devise a method to retrieve them based on point IDs. Also, the method of
clustering you choose and how you define the "top" clusters could vary depending
on your specific use case.

Since my knowledge cutoff, there may be new features or methods available in
Qdrant, or more efficient ways to retrieve vectors and perform clustering. If
you need more recent information or specifics, let me know and I can look it up.

# Clustering with DBSCAN

To find the top-k densest clusters in your vector database, you can use a
clustering algorithm like DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise), OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering
Structure), or HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise). These algorithms can effectively find dense clusters
in large datasets.

Here's a high-level outline of the steps you can take to find the top-k densest
clusters using Python:

1. Load your embedding vectors into a suitable data structure.
2. Normalize your vectors if necessary.
3. Choose a suitable clustering algorithm.
4. Tune the clustering algorithm parameters for optimal results.
5. Apply the clustering algorithm to your dataset.
6. Compute the density of the clusters found.
7. Rank the clusters by their density and select the top-k densest clusters.

Here's an example using DBSCAN with Python and scikit-learn:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from collections import Counter

# Load your embeddings (Assuming 'embeddings' is a NumPy array of shape (n, d))
# where n is the number of embedding vectors and d is their dimensionality.
embeddings = np.load('your_embeddings_file.npy')

# Normalize the embeddings if necessary
scaler = StandardScaler()
embeddings_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(embeddings)

# Choose a clustering algorithm (DBSCAN in this case)
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=0.5,
                min_samples=5)  # Tune eps and min_samples for your use case

# Apply the clustering algorithm
cluster_labels = dbscan.fit_predict(embeddings_normalized)

# Compute the densities of the clusters
cluster_density = Counter(cluster_labels)

# Sort clusters by their density
sorted_clusters = sorted(cluster_density.items(), key=lambda x: x[1],
                         reverse=True)

# Select top-k densest clusters
k = 5
top_k_clusters = sorted_clusters[:k]

print("Top-k densest clusters:", top_k_clusters)
```

Remember to tune the parameters of the clustering algorithm according to your
specific dataset and requirements. For other clustering algorithms, you can
follow similar steps and adjust the parameters accordingly.
