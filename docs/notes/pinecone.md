# How to setup Langroid and Pinecone Serverless
This document serves as a quick tutorial on how to use [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
Serverless Indexes with Langroid. We will go over some quickstart links and 
some code snippets on setting up a conversation with an LLM utilizing Langroid.

# Setting up Pinecone
Here are some reference links if you'd like to read a bit more on Pinecone's
model definitions and API:
- https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/overview
- https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/glossary
- https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/indexes/manage-indexes
- https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/introduction
## Signing up for Pinecone
To get started, you'll need to have an account. [Here's](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) where you can review the
pricing options for Pinecone. Once you have an account, you'll need to procure an API
key. Make sure to save the key you are given on initial login in a secure location. If
you were unable to save it when your account was created, you can always [create a new
API key](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/projects/manage-api-keys) in the pinecone console.
## Setting up your local environment
For the purposes of this example, we will be utilizing OpenAI for the generation of our
embeddings. As such, alongside a Pinecone API key, you'll also want an OpenAI key. You can
find a quickstart guide on getting started with OpenAI (here)[https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart].
Once you have your API key handy, you'll need to enrich your `.env` file with it.
You should have something like the following:
```env
...
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
PINECONE_API_KEY=<YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY>
...
```

# Using Langroid with Pinecone Serverless
Once you have completed signing up for an account and have added your API key
to your local environment, you can start utilizing Langroid with Pinecone.
## Setting up an Agent
Here's some example code setting up an agent:
```python
from langroid import Document, DocMetaData
from langroid.agent.special import DocChatAgent, DocChatAgentConfig
from langroid.embedding_models import OpenAIEmbeddingsConfig
from langroid.language_models import OpenAIGPTConfig, OpenAIChatModel
from langroid.parsing.parser import ParsingConfig, Splitter
from langroid.vector_store import PineconeDBConfig

agent_embed_cfg = OpenAIEmbeddingsConfig(
    model_type="openai"
)

agent_config = DocChatAgentConfig(
    llm=OpenAIGPTConfig(
        chat_model=OpenAIChatModel.GPT4o_MINI
    ),
    vecdb=PineconeDBConfig(
        # note, Pinecone indexes must be alphanumeric lowercase characters or "-"
        collection_name="pinecone-serverless-example",
        replace_collection=True,
        embedding=agent_embed_cfg,
    ),
    parsing=ParsingConfig(
        separators=["\n"],
        splitter=Splitter.SIMPLE,
        n_similar_docs=2,
    )
)

agent = DocChatAgent(config=agent_config)
