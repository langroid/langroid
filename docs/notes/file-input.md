# PDF File Attachments in Langroid

Langroid supports sending PDF files directly to Large Language Models with multi-modal 
capabilities. This feature allows models to "see" files and other documents,
and works with most multi-modal models served via an OpenAI-compatible API,
e.g.:

- OpenAI's GPT-4o series and GPT-4.1 series
- Gemini models
- Claude series models (via OpenAI-compatible providers like OpenRouter or LiteLLM )

To see example usage, see:

- tests: [test_llm.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/tests/main/test_llm.py), 
   [test_llm_async.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/tests/main/test_llm_async.py),
   [test_chat-agent.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/tests/main/test_chat_agent.py).
- example script: [pdf-json-no-parse.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/extract/pdf-json-no-parse.py), which shows
  how you can directly extract structured information from a document 
  **without having to first parse it to markdown** (which is inherently lossy).

## Basic Usage directly with LLM `chat` and `achat` methods

```python
from langroid.language_models.base import LLMMessage, Role
from langroid.parsing.file_attachment import FileAttachment
import langroid.language_models as lm

# Create a file attachment
attachment = FileAttachment.from_path("path/to/document.pdf")

# Create messages with attachment
messages = [
    LLMMessage(role=Role.SYSTEM, content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    LLMMessage(
        role=Role.USER, content="What's the title of this document?", 
        files=[attachment]
    )
]

# Set up LLM with model that supports attachments
llm = lm.OpenAIGPT(lm.OpenAIGPTConfig(chat_model=lm.OpenAIChatModel.GPT4o))

# Get response
response = llm.chat(messages=messages)
```

## Supported File Formats

Currently the OpenAI-API supports only PDFs (both image-PDFs and "true" PDFs)


## Creating Attachments

There are multiple ways to create file attachments:

```python
# From a file path
attachment = FileAttachment.from_path("path/to/file.pdf")

# From bytes
with open("path/to/file.pdf", "rb") as f:
    attachment = FileAttachment.from_bytes(f.read(), filename="document.pdf")

# From a file-like object
from io import BytesIO
file_obj = BytesIO(pdf_bytes)
attachment = FileAttachment.from_io(file_obj, filename="document.pdf")
```

## Follow-up Questions

You can continue the conversation with follow-up questions that reference the attached files:

```python
messages.append(LLMMessage(role=Role.ASSISTANT, content=response.message))
messages.append(LLMMessage(role=Role.USER, content="What is the main topic?"))
response = llm.chat(messages=messages)
```

## Multiple Attachments

Langroid allows multiple files can be sent in a single message,
but as of 16 Apr 2025, this does not appear to be properly supported in the 
APIs (they seem to only use the last file attached).

```python
messages = [
    LLMMessage(
        role=Role.USER,
        content="Compare these documents",
        files=[attachment1, attachment2]
    )
]
```

## Using File Attachments with Agents

Agents can process file attachments as well, in the `llm_response` method,
which takes a `ChatDocument` object as input. 
To pass in file attachments, include the `files` field in the `ChatDocument`,
in addition to the content:

```python
import langroid as lr
from langroid.agent.chat_document import ChatDocument, ChatDocMetaData
from langroid.mytypes import Entity


agent = lr.ChatAgent(lr.ChatAgentConfig())

user_input = ChatDocument(
    content="What is the title of this document?",
    files=[attachment],
    metadata=ChatDocMetaData(
        sender=Entity.USER,
    )
)
# or more simply, use the agent's `create_user_response` method:
# user_input = agent.create_user_response(
#     content="What is the title of this document?",
#     files=[attachment],    
# )
response = agent.llm_response(user_input)
```


## Using File Attachments with Tasks

In Langroid,  `Task.run()` can take a `ChatDocument` object as input,
and as mentioned above, it can contain attached files in the `files` field.
To ensure proper orchestration, you'd want to properly set various `metadata` fields
as well, such as `sender`, etc. Langroid provides a convenient 
`create_user_response` method to create a `ChatDocument` object with the necessary 
metadata, so you only need to specify the `content` and `files` fields:


```python
from langroid.parsing.file_attachment import FileAttachment
from langroid.agent.task import Task

agent = ...
# Create task
task = Task(agent, interactive=True)

# Create a file attachment
attachment = FileAttachment.from_path("path/to/document.pdf")

# Create input with attachment
input_message = agent.create_user_response(
    content="Extract data from this document",
    files=[attachment]
)

# Run task with file attachment
result = task.run(input_message)
```

See the script [`pdf-json-no-parse.py`]([pdf-json-no-parse.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/extract/pdf-json-no-parse.py)
for a complete example of using file attachments with tasks.

## Practical Applications

- PDF document analysis and data extraction
- Report summarization
- Structured information extraction from documents
- Visual content analysis

For more complex applications, consider using the Task and Agent infrastructure in 
Langroid to orchestrate multi-step document processing workflows.
