## How langroid handles long chat histories

You may encounter an error like this:

```
Error: Tried to shorten prompt history but ... longer than context length
```

This might happen when your chat history bumps against various limits.
Here is how Langroid handles long chat histories. Ultimately the LLM API is invoked with two key inputs:
the message history $h$, and the desired output length $n$ (defaults to the `max_output_tokens` in the 
`ChatAgentConfig`). These inputs are determined as follows (see the `ChatAgent._prep_llm_messages` method):

- let $H$ be the current message history, and $M$ be the value of `ChatAgentConfig.max_output_tokens`, and $C$ be 
  the context-length of the LLM.
- If $\text{tokens}(H) + M \leq C$, then langroid uses $h = H$ and $n = M$, since there is enough room to fit both the 
  actual chat history as well as the desired max output length.
- If $\text{tokens}(H) + M > C$, this means the context length is too small to accommodate the message history $H$ 
  and 
  the desired output length $M$. Then langroid tries to use a _shortened_ output length $n' = C - \text{tokens}(H)$, 
  i.e. the output is effectively _truncated_ to fit within the context length. 
    - If $n'$ is at least equal to `min_output_tokens` $m$ (default 10), langroid proceeds with $h = H$ and $n=n'$.
    - otherwise, this means that the message history $H$ is so long that the remaining space in the LLM's 
      context-length $C$ is unacceptably small (i.e. smaller than the minimum output length $m$). In this case,
      Langroid tries to shorten the message history by dropping early messages, and updating the message history $h$ as 
      long as $C - \text{tokens}(h) <  m$, until there are no more messages to drop (it will not drop the system 
      message or the last message, which is a user message), and throws the error mentioned above. 

If you are getting this error, you will want to check whether:

- you have set the `chat_context_length` too small, if you are setting it manually
- you have set the `max_output_tokens` too large
- you have set the `min_output_tokens` too large

If these look fine, then the next thing to look at is whether you are accumulating too much context into the agent 
history, for example retrieved passages (which can be very long) in a RAG scenario. One common case is when a query 
$Q$ is being answered using RAG, the retrieved passages $P$ are added to $Q$ to create a (potentially very long) prompt 
like 
> based on the passages P, answer query Q

Once the LLM returns an answer (if appropropriate for your context), you should avoid retaining the passages $P$ in the 
agent history, i.e. the last user message should be simply $Q$, rather than the prompt above. This functionality is exactly what you get when you 
use `ChatAgent._llm_response_temp_context`, which is used by default in the `DocChatAgent`. 

Another way to keep chat history tokens from growing too much is to use the `llm_response_forget` method, which 
erases both the query and response, if that makes sense in your scenario.

## Can I handle a tool without running a task?

Yes, if you've enabled an agent to both _use_ (i.e. generate) and _handle_ a tool. 
See the `test_tool_no_task` for an example of this. The `NabroskiTool` is enabled
for the agent, and to get the agent's LLM to generate the tool, you first do 
something like:
```python
response = agent.llm_response("What is Nabroski of 1 and 2?")
```
Now the `response` is a `ChatDocument` that will contain the JSON for the `NabroskiTool`.
To _handle_ the tool, you will need to call the agent's `agent_response` method:

```python
result = agent.agent_response(response)
```

When you wrap the agent in a task object, and do `task.run()` the above two steps are done for you,
since Langroid operates via a loop mechanism, see docs 
[here](https://langroid.github.io/langroid/quick-start/multi-agent-task-delegation/#task-collaboration-via-sub-tasks).
The *advantage* of using `task.run()` instead of doing this yourself, is that this method
ensures that tool generation errors are sent back to the LLM so it retries the generation.

## OpenAI Tools and Function-calling support

Langroid supports OpenAI tool-calls API as well as OpenAI function-calls API.
Read more [here](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/releases/tag/0.7.0).

Langroid has always had its own native tool-calling support as well, 
which works with **any** LLM -- you can define a subclass of `ToolMessage` (pydantic based) 
and it is transpiled into system prompt instructions for the tool. 
In practice, we don't see much difference between using this vs OpenAI fn-calling. 
Example [here](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/fn-call-local-simple.py).
Or search for `ToolMessage` in any of the `tests/` or `examples/` folders.

## Some example scripts appear to return to user input immediately without handling a tool.

This is because the `task` has been set up with `interactive=True` 
(which is the default). With this setting, the task loop waits for user input after
either the `llm_response` or `agent_response` (typically a tool-handling response) 
returns a valid response. If you want to progress through the task, you can simply 
hit return, unless the prompt indicates that the user needs to enter a response.

Alternatively, the `task` can be set up with `interactive=False` -- with this setting,
the task loop will _only_ wait for user input when an entity response (`llm_response` 
or `agent_response`) _explicitly_ addresses the user. Explicit user addressing can
be done using either:

- an orchestration tool, e.g. `SendTool` (see details in
the release notes for [0.9.0](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/releases/tag/0.9.0)), an example script is the [multi-agent-triage.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/multi-agent-triage.py), or 
- a special addressing prefix, see the example script [1-agent-3-tools-address-user.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/1-agent-3-tools-address-user.py)


## Can I specify top_k in OpenAIGPTConfig (for LLM API calls)?

No; Langroid currently only supports parameters accepted by OpenAI's API, and `top_k` is _not_ one of them. See:

- [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)
- [Discussion on top_k, top_p, temperature](https://community.openai.com/t/temperature-top-p-and-top-k-for-chatbot-responses/295542/5)
- [Langroid example](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/fn-call-local-numerical.py) showing how you can set other OpenAI API parameters, using the `OpenAICallParams` object.


## Can I persist agent state across multiple runs?

For example, you may want to stop the current python script, and 
run it again later, resuming your previous conversation.
Currently there is no built-in Langroid mechanism for this, but you can 
achieve a basic type of persistence by saving the agent's `message_history`:

-  if you used `Task.run()` in your script, make sure the task is 
set up with `restart=False` -- this prevents the agent state from being reset when 
the task is run again.
- using python's pickle module, you can save the `agent.message_history` to a file,
and load it (if it exists) at the start of your script.

See the example script [`chat-persist.py`](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/chat-persist.py)

For more complex persistence, you can take advantage of the `GlobalState`,
where you can store message histories of multiple agents indexed by their name.
Simple examples of `GlobalState` are in the [`chat-tree.py`](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/chat-tree.py) example, 
and the [`test_global_state.py`](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/tests/main/test_global_state.py) test.

## How can I suppress LLM output?

You can use the `quiet_mode` context manager for this, see 
[here](https://langroid.github.io/langroid/notes/quiet-mode/)

## How can I deal with LLMs (especially weak ones) generating bad JSON in tools?

Langroid already attempts to repair bad JSON (e.g. unescaped newlines, missing quotes, etc)  
using the [json-repair](https://github.com/mangiucugna/json_repair) library and other
custom methods, before attempting to parse it into a `ToolMessage` object.
However this type of repair may not be able to handle all edge cases of bad JSON 
from weak LLMs. There are two existing ways to deal with this, and one coming soon:

- If you are defining your own `ToolMessage` subclass, considering deriving it instead
  from `XMLToolMessage` instead, see the [XML-based Tools](https://langroid.github.io/langroid/notes/xml-tools/)
- If you are using an existing Langroid `ToolMessage`, e.g. `SendTool`, you can 
  define your own subclass of `SendTool`, say `XMLSendTool`,
  inheriting from both `SendTool` and `XMLToolMessage`; see this 
  [example](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/xml_tool.py)
- Coming soon: strict decoding to leverage the Structured JSON outputs supported by OpenAI
  and open LLM providers such as `llama.cpp` and `vllm`.

The first two methods instruct the LLM to generate XML instead of JSON,
and any field that is designated with a `verbatim=True` will be enclosed 
within an XML `CDATA` tag, which does *not* require any escaping, and can
be far more reliable for tool-use than JSON, especially with weak LLMs.
