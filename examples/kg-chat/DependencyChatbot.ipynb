        "\n",
        "This is a rapidly growing field, especially in light of the significant increase in software supply chain attacks. It focuses primarily on understanding and managing the dependencies in your software supply chain. With the rise of open-source and third-party components in software development, the need for supply chain security has become more critical than ever. Organizations are now realizing the importance of vetting and monitoring the components and dependencies they rely on to ensure the integrity and security of their software. As this field continues to evolve, it will be essential for developers and organizations to stay proactive in addressing supply chain vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Managing dependencies starts with the ability to identify direct and transitive dependencies. Normally, this involves obtaining the full dependency graph, and writing custom code to answer questions about dependencies. In this colab, we introduce a far simpler approach with 2 key innovations:\n",
        "- store the dependency graph in a graph-db, specifically neo4j,\n",
        "- use an LLM-powered Agent that translates a user's questions into the query language of neo4j (known as Cypher)\n"

        "4.   The chatbot will construct the dependency graph of the package including transitive dependencies.\n",
        "5.   At this stage, the user can ask the chatbot any question about the dependency graph, such as:\n",
        "  *   What are the packages at level 2?\n",
        "  *   Tell me 3 interesting things about the dependency graph?\n",
        "6.   For some questions that the chatbot can't answer from the the graph, it can use a web search tool to obtain additional information. For example, to identify the package version, the chatbot will use the web search tool.\n",
