"""
Example showing how to chat with a graph database generated from
unstructured data.

This example will automatically:
- create triplets that represent various entities and relationships from the text
- generate the cypher query to populate the triplets in the graph database
- generate all the required Cypher queries for Neo4j to answer user's questions.

This example relies on neo4j. The easiest way to get access to neo4j is by
creating a cloud account at `https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/`

Upon creating the account successfully, neo4j will create a text file that contains
account settings, please provide the following information (uri, username, password) as
described here
`https://github.com/langroid/langroid/tree/main/examples/kg-chat#requirements`

Run like this

python3 examples/kg-chat/text-kg.py

Optional args:
* -d or --debug to enable debug mode
* -nc or --nocache to disable caching
* -m or --model to specify a model name
