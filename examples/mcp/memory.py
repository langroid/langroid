"""
Simple example of using the Memory MCP server:
https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory
This server gives your agent persistent memory using a local Knowledge Graph,
so when you re-start the chat it will remember what you talked about last time.


The server offers several tools, and we can enable ALL of them to be used
by a Langroid agent.

Run like this (-m model optional; defaults to gpt-4.1-mini):

    uv run examples/mcp/memory.py --m ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b
