"""
Demonstrating the utility of Hypothetical Questions (HQ) in the context of a
DocChatAgent.

In the following example, a DocChatAgent is created and it can be queried on its
documents both in a normal way and in a hypothetical way.

Although this is being referred to as Hypothetical Questions, it is not limited to
just questions -- it is simply a way to augment the document-chunks at ingestion time,
with keywords that increase the "semantic surface" of the chunks to improve
retrieval accuracy.

This example illustrates the benefit of HQ in a medical scenario
where each "document chunk" is simply the name of a medical test
(e.g. "cholesterol", "BUN", "PSA", etc)
and when `use_hypothetical_question` is enabled,
the chunk (i.e. test name) is augment it with keywords that add more
context, such as which organ it is related to
(e.g., "heart", "kidney", "prostate", etc).
This way, when a user asks "which tests are related to kidney health",
these augmentations ensure that the test names are retrieved more accurately.

Running the script compares the accuracy of
results of the DocChatAgent with and without HQ.

Run like this to use HQ:

python3 examples/docqa/hypothetical_questions.py

or without HQ:

python3 examples/docqa/hypothetical_questions.py --no-use-hq
