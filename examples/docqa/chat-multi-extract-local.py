"""
Extract structured info from a commercial lease document,
using multiple agents, powered by a weaker/local LLM, combining tools/functions and RAG.

TASK:
Given a lease document, generate the lease terms, organized into
 a nested JSON structure defined by the Pydantic class `Lease`

Solution with Langroid Agents and tools:
1. QuestionGeneratorAgent: Lease JSON Spec -> list of questions to ask
2. InterrogatorAgent: For each question, generate 2 variants of the question,
   so we use total 3 variants per question, joined together, to increase
   the likelihood of getting an answer from the DocAgent (RAG).
3. DocAgent (has access to the lease) -> answer one question using RAG
3. LeasePresenterAgent: List of (question, answer) pairs ->
        organized into specified Lease JSON structure

Run like this:
```
python3 examples/docqa/chat-multi-extract-local.py -m ollama/mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q8_0
```
This works with a local mistral-instruct-v0.2 model.
(To use with ollama, first do `ollama run <model>` then
specify the model name as -m ollama/<model>)

See here for how to set up a Local LLM to work with Langroid:
https://langroid.github.io/langroid/tutorials/local-llm-setup/

Optional script args:
-m <local-model-name>, e.g. -m ollama/mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q8_0
(if omitted, defaults to GPT4o)
-nc to disable cache retrieval
-d to enable debug mode: see prompts, agent msgs etc.
