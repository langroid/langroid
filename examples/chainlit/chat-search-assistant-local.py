Chainlit version of examples/basic/chat-search-assistant-local.py,
with a minor change to enable Chainlit callbacks.
Tested and works ok nous-hermes2-mixtral, but may still have issues.
See that script for details.

You can specify a local in a few different ways, e.g. `-m local/localhost:8000/v1`
or `-m ollama/mistral` etc. See here how to use Langroid with local LLMs:
