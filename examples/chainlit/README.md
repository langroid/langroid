# Running the chainlit apps

In your Python virtual env, ensure you have 
installed `langroid` with the `chainlit` extra using, e.g.

```bash
pip install langroid[chainlit]
```

Or if you already have `langroid` installed, you can install the `chainlit` extra using:

```bash
pip install chainlit
```

To check that `chainlit` is installed, run:

```bash
chainlit hello
```

and you should see the `hello app` open in your browser.
