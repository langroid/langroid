"""
A toy numerical example showing how two agents can collaborate on a task.

The Student Agent is tasked with calculating the sum of a list of numbers,
and is told that it knows nothing about addition, and can ask for help
from an Adder Agent who can add pairs of numbers.

Run as follows (omit -m to default to GTP4o):

python3 examples/quick-start/two-agent-chat-num.py -m ollama/qwen2.5:latest

            I can help you add numbers, two at a time, since
            I only know how to add pairs of numbers.
            Send me a pair of numbers to add, one at a time, 
            and I will tell you their sum.
            For each question, simply ask me the sum in math notation, 
            e.g., simply say "1 + 2", etc, and say nothing else.
            Once you have added all the numbers in the list, 
            say DONE and give me the final sum.
