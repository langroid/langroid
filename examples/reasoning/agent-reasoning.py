"""
Simple example showing how you can separately
extract the reasoning (thinking) and final response from a langroid ChatAgent

Run like this (omit the model argument to default to the deepseek-reasoner model):

    python examples/reasoning/agent-reasoning.py \
    --model  gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp

or
    uv run examples/reasoning/agent-reasoning.py

Other reasoning models to try:
openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1
o1
o1-mini
o3-mini
ollama/deepseek-r1:8b
gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp
