"""
Function-calling example using a local LLM, with ollama.

"Function-calling" refers to the ability to ability of the LLM to generate
a structured response, typically a JSON object, instead of a plain text response,
which is then interpreted by your code to perform some action.
This is also referred to in various scenarios as "Tools", "Actions" or "Plugins".

# (1) Mac: Install latest ollama, then do this:
# ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q4_K_M"

# (2) Ensure you've installed the `litellm` extra with Langroid, e.g.
# pip install langroid[litellm], or if you use the `pyproject.toml` in this repo
# you can simply use `poetry install`

# (3) Run like this:

python3 examples/docqa/fn-call-local-simple.py

To change the local model, use the optional arg -m <local_model>.
See this [script](https://github.com/langroid/langroid-examples/blob/main/examples/docqa/rag-local-simple.py)
for other ways to specify the local_model.
