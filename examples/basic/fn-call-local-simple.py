"""
Function-calling example using a local LLM, with ollama.

"Function-calling" refers to the ability of the LLM to generate
a structured response, typically a JSON object, instead of a plain text response,
which is then interpreted by your code to perform some action.
This is also referred to in various scenarios as "Tools", "Actions" or "Plugins".

Run like this --

python3 examples/basic/fn-call-local-simple.py -m <local_model_name>

See here for how to set up a Local LLM to work with Langroid:
