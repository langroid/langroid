"""
2 Agent setup where Main agent asks a question, Helper has a few tools to help answer,
and for any question, Helper finishes after first use of any tool.

Run like this:

python3 examples/basic/2-agent-tools.py

When it waits for user input, try asking things like:

- capital of uganda?
    => Main answers
- polinsky of 4?
    => Main says do not know, handled by helper, who returns answer
- chichikov of 5?
    => Main says do not know, handled by helper, who returns answer
