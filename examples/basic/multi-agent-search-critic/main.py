"""
Version of chat-search-assistant.py that is more likely to work local LLMs.

3-Agent system where:
- Assistant takes user's (complex) question, breaks it down into smaller pieces
    if needed
- Searcher takes Assistant's question, uses the Search tool to search the web
    (using DuckDuckGo), and returns a coherent answer to the Assistant.
- Critic takes Assistant's final answer, and provides feedback on it.

Once the Assistant thinks it has enough info to answer the user's question, it
says DONE and presents the answer to the user.

See also: chat-search for a basic single-agent search

Run like this from rool of repo:

python3 -m examples.basic.multi-agent-search-critic.main

There are optional args, especially note these:

-m <model_name>: to run with a different LLM model (default: gpt4-turbo)

For example try this question:

during which years did Beethoven live, and does his life overlap with that of Liszt?

You can specify a local in a few different ways, e.g. `-m local/localhost:8000/v1`
or `-m ollama/mistral` etc. See here how to use Langroid with local LLMs:
