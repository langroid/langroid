"""
Illustrates a Planner agent orchestrating a multi-step workflow by using tools that
invoke other specialized agents.

- The PlannerAgent is instructed to first increment a number by 3, and then
  multiply the result by 8.
- To do this, it repeatedly uses two tools: `IncrementTool` and `DoublingTool`.
- The key idea is that these tools are stateful: their `handle_async` methods
  don't perform the simple math themselves, but instead run other `Task` objects
  (`increment_task`, `doubling_task`).
- These tasks are handled by simple, specialized agents (`IncrementAgent`,
  `DoublingAgent`) that only know how to perform a single, small step.

This example showcases a powerful pattern where a high-level agent delegates complex
sub-processes to other agents via the tool mechanism.

Run like this from the repo root, once you are in a virtual environment with
langroid installed:

    uv run examples/basic/planner-workflow-simple.py

To use a different model, for example, run like this:

    uv run examples/basic/planner-workflow-simple.py --model gpt-4.1-mini

        Note That even though these tasks sound trivial, you cannot and must not do them 
        yourself. You must use the tools as many times as needed for each step and then 
        proceed to the next step. 
        
        Once you are done, use the TOOL `{DoneTool.name()}` to return the final result.
