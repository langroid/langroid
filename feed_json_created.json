Introducing an <a href=\"https://github.com/langroid/langroid/tree/main/examples/multi-agent-debate\">AI-powered debate platform</a> that brings \nthis imagination to reality, leveraging diverse LLMs and the Langroid multi-agent programming framework. The system enables users to engage in structured debates with an AI taking the opposite stance (or even two AIs debating each other), using a multi-agent architecture with Langroid's powerful framework, where each agent embodies a specific ethical perspective, creating realistic and dynamic interactions. \nAgents are prompt-engineered and role-tuned to align with their assigned ethical stance, \nensuring thoughtful and structured debates. </p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2025-02-04T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Shams"}], "tags": ["chat", "langroid", "llm", "local-llm"]}, {"id": "https://langroid.github.io/langroid/blog/2024/08/15/overview-of-langroids-multi-agent-architecture-prelim/", "url": "https://langroid.github.io/langroid/blog/2024/08/15/overview-of-langroids-multi-agent-architecture-prelim/", "title": "Overview of Langroid's Multi-Agent Architecture (prelim)", "content_html": "<h2>Agent, as an intelligent message transformer</h2>\n<p>A natural and convenient abstraction in designing a complex\nLLM-powered system is the notion of an <em>agent</em> that is instructed to be responsible for a specific aspect of the \noverall task.
