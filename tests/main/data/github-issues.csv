open,2024,1,5,,,"I think it would be interesting to have different templates (.github/**/*.md) for various purposes within your repo. Templates can significantly enhance efficiency and clarity in communication, especially when dealing with different aspects of your code/repo. Imagine having specific templates tailored for bug reports, allowing users to succinctly detail the issue they encountered, including steps to reproduce. This standardized format would streamline the debugging process, making it more organized and time-effective.

Similarly, having a dedicated template for reporting issues can help users express concerns or suggestions in a structured manner. Users could provide essential details, such as the nature of the problem, its impact, and any relevant markdown/screenshots, making it easier for the team to comprehend and address their concerns promptly.

Moreover, the inclusion of a feature request template could be a valuable addition. Users often have innovative ideas or specific functionalities they'd like to see implemented. A feature request template could guide users in articulating their suggestions comprehensively, specifying the intended benefits and potential use cases. This structured approach would empower your development team to better understand and evaluate the feasibility and significance of each proposed feature.

In conclusion, introducing different templates for bug reports, issue reports, and feature requests can enhance the overall user experience by promoting clear and concise communication. This, in turn, facilitates more efficient problem resolution, ensuring that your platform remains responsive to user needs and continually evolves with valuable user input.

open,2024,1,5,BruceMacD,,"I thought I'd post this here in case it helps others suffering from OOM errors as I searched and can see no mention of either ""num_batch"" or ""n_batch"" anywhere here.

I've been having endless problems with OOM errors when I try to run models with a context length of 16k like ""deepseek-coder:33b-instruct"" and originally thought it was due to this:

```
// 75% of the absolute max number of layers we can fit in available VRAM, off-loading too many layers to the GPU can cause OOM errors
layers := int(info.FreeMemory/bytesPerLayer) * 3 / 4
```

But whatever I set that to (even tiny fractions like 1 / 100), I would still eventually get an OOM error after inputting a lot of data to the 16k models... I could actually see the VRAM use go up using nvidia-smi in Linux until it hit the 24GB of my 4090 and then crash.

So next I tried ""num_gpu=0"" and this did work (I  still got the benefit of the cuBLAS for the prompt evaluation, but otherwise very slow generation...). As soon as I set this to even ""num_gpu =1"" then I would get an OOM error after inputting a lot of data (but still way less than 16k tokens) to the 16k models.

So I then went into the Ollama source and found there are some hidden ""PARAMETER"" settings not mentioned in ""/docs/modelfile.md "" that can be found in ""api/types.go"" and one of these is ""num_batch"" (which corresponds to ""n_batch"" in llama.cpp) and it turns out this is was the solution. The default value is 512 (which is inherited from llama.cpp) and I found that reducing it finally solved the OOT crash problem.

It looks like there may even be a relationship that it needs to be decreased by num_ctx/4096 (= 4 for the 16k context models), and this in turn could possibly have something to do with the 3 / 4 magic number in the code above and/or the fact tbat 4096 is a very common default context size?? Anyway, setting to 128 *almost* worked unless I deliberately fed in a file I have created that I know deepseek-coder:33b-instruct will tokenize into 16216 tokens... So I then reduced to 64 and have since fed this same file in 4-5 times using the chat completion API so the complete conversation is > 64k tokens and it still hasn't crashed yet  (the poor thing had a meltdown after 64k tokens and just replied ""I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that"" though lol).

I suspect I could get even closer to 128 as it did almost work but atm I'm just leaving it at 64 to see how I get on...

It should be noted that num_batch has to be >=32 (as per the llama.cpp docs) or otherwise it won't use the cuBLAS kernels for prompt evaluations at all.

I suggest anybody suffering from similar OOM errors add this to their modelfiles, starting at 32:

```PARAMETER num_batch 32```

and keep doubling it until you get the OOM errors again."

Not everyone runs Ollama on the local machine. As for me I run it on Kubernetes and use it always with its langchain library. For that proper authentication is required.

**How:**
I propose to keep Ollma ""as-is"" and let the wrapping platform define the authentication. That way, only the langchain components need enhancement to offer OAuth or basic authentication through parameters ("".env"").

Sometimes, me may only need to validate than we can compile a model with `ollama`...without having to download the whole base model.

**👉 In  a few words, this would help telling, very fast and very easily is a `ollama` modelfile could be used. 👈** 

# 💡 Feature request

Implement `ollama --verify` which exits with success if:

- ✔️ the file is well formated
- ✔️ the base image exists

# 💰 Benefits

- **Make it possible to implement code validation with CI**... and then protect source code
- **Save resources (storage, CPU)** while trying to validate a `ollama` modelfile (especially on GH Actions)

First of all, thank you for your amazing work! 🤩 I have been using Ollama for a while now and I'm really enjoying it.

I was wondering if we could introduce a API documentation website (right from GitHub using GH Pages). Along with this we could also have a GitHub action workflow setup to auto-build and deploy the API documentation when a release is created.

I think it would be greatly helpful for someone to get started with basics (including setup, how and why Ollama is used, etc) and then progressively navigate through the documentation to explore more and try more advanced stuff via a more user-friendly UI.

I was thinking if I could setup a skeleton structure for the documentation using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). That way, we can have well structured comprehensive API documentation such as [this](https://amithkoujalgi.github.io/ollama4j/docs/intro).

:point_right: How to stay up-to-date with the models I rely on :point_left: 

For now, there are two manual ways to be aware of new releases:

- Follow news on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jmorgan/status/1740703457953321144)
- Get kind comments on a [given issue](https://github.com/adriens/ollama-models/issues/1)
- Frequently refresh the [`ollama` library](https://ollama.ai/library) and search new tags

# :bulb: Idea

The main idea would to be able to configure a GH Ation, like a Dependabot that would be able to make PRs on the model files of a repo and push new versions on the `FROM` part of any ollama model file.

At the end, we would get that kind of PR:
- https://github.com/adriens/ollama-models/pull/2

- Stay up-to-date w/ model files at scale but effortless

open,2023,12,27,,,"Hi, I'm looking for a way to add function call to work with Ollama and LlamaIndex.

From my research we have format json in Ollama, so theoretically, there are 2 ways we can support function call:
1.  Enforce the LLM to output json following a schema, and we can call the function based on the json output.
  * Not sure how reliable it is for this approach, has anyone been able to have a consistent output from the LLM for the exact prompt?
  * Client side also need to implement a retry mechanism so we will feed the previous output and errors back to LLM and ask it to regenerate
  * What are schemas and data structure that we should use? Currently, most people seem to go with OpenAI function call schema, but it does not support validation and we probably need to have a pydantic model and keep it up-to-date for LLM response's validation.
  * Some examples: https://github.com/lgrammel/modelfusion/blob/main/examples/basic/src/model-provider/ollama/ollama-chat-use-tools-or-generator-text-mistral-example.ts 

2. We can also add API in Ollama itself to support function call directly, similar to OpenAI.
  * I'm not sure how this will work, especially OpenAI is not open source. Do you think it's possible to implement the function call feature directly in Ollama?
    * I'm not sure will we need to have a specific model that support function call, and we can feed `{ role: ""tool"", content: ""tool output"" }` into the LLM
    * Or it's simply the feature we can add at the API level.
