When it is your turn to enter a message, you can do one of two things:
- write `c` to tell the agent to continue,
    - This is provided as a safeguard against infinite loops, or to prevent a large 
    amount of text to be sent to the LLM (which can be costly + slow). 
    If you simply want to continue with normal operation, just enter c.
- write a response, question or feedback to the agent, depending on context.
