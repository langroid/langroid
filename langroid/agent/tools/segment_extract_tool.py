"""
A tool to extract segment numbers from the last user message,
containing numbered segments.

The idea is that when an LLM wants to (or is asked to) simply extract
portions of a message verbatim, it should use this tool/function to
SPECIFY what should be extracted, rather than actually extracting it.
The output will be in the form of a list of segment numbers or ranges.
This will usually be much cheaper and faster than actually writing out the extracted
text. The handler of this tool/function will then extract the text and send it back.
