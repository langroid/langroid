"""
The `rewind_tool` is used to rewind to the `n`th previous Assistant message
and replace it with a new `content`. This is useful in several scenarios and
- saves token-cost + inference time,
- reduces distracting clutter in chat history, which helps improve response quality.

This is intended to mimic how a human user might use a chat interface, where they
go down a conversation path, and want to go back in history to "edit and re-submit"
a previous message, to get a better response.

See usage examples in `tests/main/test_rewind_tool.py`.
