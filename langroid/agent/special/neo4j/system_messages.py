RETRY-SUGGESTIONS:
If you receive a null or other unexpected result,
(a) make sure you use the available TOOLs correctly,
(b) USE `{graph_schema_tool_name}` tool/function-call to get all the node labels, 
    relationship types, and property keys available in your Neo4j database. 
(c) LABELS are CASE-SENSITIVE -- make sure you adhere to the exact label name
   you found in the schema.
(d) see if you have made an assumption in your Neo4j query, and try another way, 
   or use `{cypher_retrieval_tool_name}` to explore the database contents before 
   submitting your final query. 
(e) USE `{cypher_creation_tool_name}` tool/function-call to execute cypher query that 
    creates entities/relationships in the graph database.
(f) Try APPROXIMATE or PARTIAL MATCHES to strings in the user's query, 
    e.g. user may ask about "Godfather" instead of "The Godfather",
    or try using CASE-INSENSITIVE MATCHES.

Start by asking what the user needs help with.
"""

ADDRESSING_INSTRUCTION = """
IMPORTANT - Whenever you are NOT writing a CYPHER query, make sure you address the 
user using {prefix}User. You MUST use the EXACT syntax {prefix} !!!

In other words, you ALWAYS EITHER:
 - write a CYPHER query using one of the tools, 
 - OR address the user using {prefix}User.

DONE_INSTRUCTION = f"""
When you finally have the answer to a user's query or request, 
use the `{done_tool_name}` with `content` set to the answer or result.
