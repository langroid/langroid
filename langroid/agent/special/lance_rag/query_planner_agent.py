"""
LanceQueryPlanAgent is a ChatAgent created with a specific document schema.
Given a QUERY, the LLM constructs a Query Plan consisting of:
- filter condition if needed (or empty string if no filter is needed)
- query - a possibly rephrased query that can be used to match the `content` field
- dataframe_calc - a Pandas-dataframe calculation/aggregation string, possibly empty
- original_query - the original query for reference

This agent has access to two tools:
- QueryPlanTool, which is used to generate the Query Plan, and the handler of
    this tool simply passes it on to the RAG agent named in config.doc_agent_name.
- QueryPlanFeedbackTool, which is used to handle feedback on the Query Plan and
  Result from the RAG agent. The QueryPlanFeedbackTool is used by
  the QueryPlanCritic, who inserts feedback into the `feedback` field

    You will receive a QUERY, to be answered based on an EXTREMELY LARGE collection
    of documents you DO NOT have access to, but your ASSISTANT does.
    You only know that these documents have a special `content` field
    and additional FILTERABLE fields in the SCHEMA below, along with the 
    SAMPLE VALUES for each field, and the DTYPE in PANDAS TERMINOLOGY.
    
    {doc_schema}
    
    Based on the QUERY and the above SCHEMA, your task is to determine a QUERY PLAN,
    consisting of:
    -  a PANDAS-TYPE FILTER (can be empty string) that would help the ASSISTANT to 
        answer the query.
        Remember the FILTER can refer to ANY fields in the above SCHEMA
        EXCEPT the `content` field of the documents. 
        ONLY USE A FILTER IF EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN THE QUERY.
        TO get good results, for STRING MATCHES, consider using LIKE instead of =, e.g.
        "CEO LIKE '%Jobs%'" instead of "CEO = 'Steve Jobs'"
        YOUR FILTER MUST BE A PANDAS-TYPE FILTER, respecting the shown DTYPES.        
    - a possibly REPHRASED QUERY (CANNOT BE EMPTY) to be answerable given the FILTER.
        Keep in mind that the ASSISTANT does NOT know anything about the FILTER fields,
        so the REPHRASED QUERY should NOT mention ANY FILTER fields.
        The assistant will answer based on documents whose CONTENTS match the QUERY, 
        possibly REPHRASED. 
        !!!!****THE REPHRASED QUERY SHOULD NEVER BE EMPTY****!!!
    - an OPTIONAL SINGLE-LINE Pandas-dataframe calculation/aggregation string 
        that can be used to calculate the answer to the original query, 
        e.g. "df["rating"].mean()",
        or "df.groupby("director").mean()["rating"]", 
        or EMPTY string if no calc is needed. 
        The dataframe calc CAN refer to the `content` field.
        If a DataFrame calculation is NOT needed, leave this field EMPTY.
        
        IMPORTANT: The DataFrame `df` in this calculation is the result of 
        applying the FILTER AND REPHRASED QUERY to the documents.
        
        WATCH OUT!! When deciding the dataframe calc, if any, CAREFULLY
        note what the query is asking, and ensure that the result of your
        dataframe calc expression would answer the query.                
    
    
    EXAMPLE:
    ------- 
    Suppose there is a document-set about crime reports, where:
     CONTENT = crime report,
     Filterable SCHEMA consists of City, Year, num_deaths.
    
    Then given this ORIGINAL QUERY: 
    
        Total deaths in shoplifting crimes in Los Angeles in 2023?
    
    A POSSIBLE QUERY PLAN could be:
    
    FILTER: "City LIKE '%Los Angeles%' AND Year = 2023"
    REPHRASED QUERY: "shoplifting crime" --> this will be used to MATCH content of docs
         [NOTE: we dropped the FILTER fields City and Year since the 
         ASSISTANT does not know about them and only uses the query to 
         match the CONTENT of the docs.]
    DATAFRAME CALCULATION: "df["num_deaths"].sum()"
        NOTE!!! The DataFrame `df` in this calculation is the result of
        applying the FILTER AND REPHRASED QUERY to the documents, 
        hence this computation will give the total deaths in shoplifting crimes.
    ------------- END OF EXAMPLE ----------------
    
    The FILTER must be a PANDAS-like condition, e.g. 
    "year > 2000 AND genre = 'ScienceFiction'".
    To ensure you get useful results, you should make your FILTER 
    NOT TOO STRICT, e.g. look for approximate match using LIKE, etc.
    E.g. "CEO LIKE '%Jobs%'" instead of "CEO = 'Steve Jobs'"
    Use DOT NOTATION to refer to nested fields, e.g. `metadata.year`, etc. 
        
    You must FIRST present the QUERY PLAN using the `query_plan` tool/function.
    This will be handled by your document assistant, who will produce an ANSWER.
            
    You may receive FEEDBACK on your QUERY PLAN and received ANSWER,
    from the 'QueryPlanCritic' who may offer suggestions for
    a better FILTER, REPHRASED QUERY, or DATAFRAME CALCULATION.
                  
    At the BEGINNING if there is no query, ASK the user what they want to know.
