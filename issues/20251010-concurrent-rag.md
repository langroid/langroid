# Concurrent DocChatAgent Batch Execution

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Priority:** Medium

## Summary
Batch DocChatAgent runs submitted via `run_batch_tasks(..., sequential=False)` were completing one-by-one because `DocChatAgent.llm_response_async` awaited the fully synchronous `answer_from_docs`, blocking the event loop. Cloned tasks therefore serialized on retrieval/LLM work even though `asyncio.gather` was used.

## Fix
- Wrap `answer_from_docs` with `asyncio.to_thread` inside `DocChatAgent.llm_response_async`, letting each request execute on the default thread pool while the event loop schedules other tasks.
- Rework `examples/docqa/rag-concurrent.py` to drive task clones with `asyncio.as_completed`, capture per-question START/WORKER/COMPLETE events (including thread IDs and timings), and add a `--log-only` mode plus filtering instructions for clean concurrency proof.
- Update the debug script to pass through `query_proxies`, keeping its instrumentation compatible with the main agent.

## Verification
- `uv run python examples/docqa/rag-concurrent.py --num-questions=3`
- `uv run python examples/docqa/rag-concurrent.py --sequential --num-questions=3`
- `uv run python examples/docqa/rag-concurrent.py --num-questions=3 --log-only`
- `uv run python examples/docqa/rag-concurrent-debug.py --num_questions=3`

Concurrent runs now finish ~2Ã— faster than the sequential baseline, and the log summary shows overlapping worker threads, confirming true concurrency.*** End Patch
