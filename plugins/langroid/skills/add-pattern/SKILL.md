description: Use this skill when you learn one or more design pattern(s) in the
  Langroid (multi) agent framework, and want to make a note for future reference
  for yourself. Use this either autonomously, or when asked by the user to record 
  a new pattern.

# add-pattern

## Instructions

When you learn a new Langroid design pattern, do the following:

1. Add an entry in the sibling `patterns/SKILL.md` file in the appropriate category
   section, containing a DESCRIPTION of the goal of the pattern (i.e. what it enables
   you to implement), accompanied by a `- Reference:` pointer to a markdown DOCUMENT
   in the `patterns/` directory.

   IMPORTANT - The DESCRIPTION should be clear enough that future YOU can effectively
   use it to MATCH design problems you may encounter in future.

2. In that DOCUMENT, describe the idea of the implementation along with code examples.
   Follow the format of existing pattern files (Problem, Solution, Complete Code
   Example, Key Points, When to Use).
